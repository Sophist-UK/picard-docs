  <https://picard.musicbrainz.org/docs/guide/>`_.

  updated plugin versions.


Reporting a Bug
---------------

If you think you have found a bug please check whether you are using the latest version of Picard and whether the
bug has already been reported in the `bug tracker <https://tickets.musicbrainz.org/browse/PICARD>`_. If you're not
sure or don't want to look through the existing tickets, ask on the community forums first.

If you're still convinced you have found a new bug, open a `new ticket
<https://tickets.musicbrainz.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=10042&issuetype=1>`_ providing the following information:

* Which version of Picard do you use? ("Affects Version" in the form)
* Which operating system do you use? ("Environment" in the form)
* What did you do when the bug occurred?
* What actually happened and what did you expect to happen?
* If you're using plugins, which plugins do you have enabled?


Getting Logs
------------

For many bugs, it helps developers to have a log from Picard. You can see the log by going to :menuselection:`"Help --> View Log"`.
You can also get a full debug log (better because it contains more detailed information) by starting Picard with `-d` as a
command-line argument. If you're using Windows, you can change your shortcut's Target (:menuselection:`right click shortcut -->
Properties`) to::

    "C:\Program Files\MusicBrainz Picard\picard.exe" -d

Pasting this log into your forum post or bug ticket can help developers and other users to resolve your issue more quickly.
